  abstract = {The announcement by Sony Pictures that it would not release The Interview for screening in major US theaters as planned was the culmination of a series of events that featured elements of cyber warfare and psychological warfare, and threatened to spill over into physical terrorism. The incident occurred where the worlds of policy and of culture converge, namely, politics. The implication of this extraordinary affair goes far beyond a North Korean conflict with Sony and the United States; it even goes beyond economics, though the wave of attacks caused the Sony Corporation tremendous financial losses in addition to the direct damage resulting from the decision not to distribute the movie. At stake is a fundamental value of the West in general and the United States in particular â€“ the right of free speech. The purpose of the attack, attributed to North Korea, was to deter Sony Pictures from releasing the movie, which was understood (correctly) as ridiculing that country's dictator and portraying the North Korean regime and its leader, Kim Jong-Un, with sarcasm and mockery. At first, North Korea reacted via diplomatic channels in an attempt to prevent the movie's distribution and screening. It subsequently announced that as far as it was concerned, screening the movie was a declaration of war that would not be ignored or tolerated. Under pressure, Sony altered the script in an effort to lessen the scorn, but Pyongyang was not mollified. As the production of the movie progressed and reached the point of distribution, Sony became the target of a wave of cyberattacks that climaxed when personal data of company employees, such as salaries, Social Security numbers, and emails were made public; company servers and computers were hacked, interrupting work at the company for about a week; and scripts and various versions of new movies in production at Sony were leaked to the internet. The attacks were most likely carried out by a group of hackers calling themselves the Guardians of Peace. Although North Korea is an isolated nation with little internet access, it is believed to have highly developed cyber capabilities. Indeed, the attack against Sony supports that assessment of the nation's cyberspace know-how, already demonstrated in cyberattacks against South Korea, for example.},

Six research groups participated in a blind evaluation and results were analyzed for probe, denial-of-service (DoS) remote-to-local (R2L), and user to root (U2R) attacks. The best systems detected old attacks included in the training data, at moderate detection rates ranging from 63{\%} to 93{\%} at a false alarm rate of 10 false alarms per day. Detection rates were much worse for new and novel R2L and DoS attacks included only in the test data. The best systems failed to detect roughly half these new attacks which included damaging access to root-level privileges by remote users. These results suggest that further research should focus on developing techniques to find new attacks instead of extending existing rule-based approaches},

It uses a hybrid of vertical and horizontal parallelism to distribute Adaptive Model Rules (AMRules) on a cluster. The decision rules built by AMRules are comprehensible models, where the antecedent of a rule is a conjunction of conditions on the attribute values, and the consequent is a linear combination of the attributes. Our evaluation shows that this implementation is scalable in relation to CPU and memory consumption. On a small commodity Samza cluster of 9 nodes, it can handle a rate of more than 30 000 instances per second, and achieve a speedup of up to 4 . 7x over the sequential version.},

In this context, several data stream clustering algorithms have been proposed to perform unsupervised learning. Nevertheless, data stream clustering imposes several challenges to be addressed, such as dealing with nonstationary, unbounded data that arrive in an online fashion. The intrinsic nature of stream data requires the development of algorithms capable of performing fast and incremental processing of data objects, suitably addressing time and memory limitations. In this article, we present a survey of data stream clustering algorithms, providing a thorough discussion of the main design components of state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, this work addresses the temporal aspects involved in data stream clustering, and presents an overview of the usually employed experimental methodologies. A number of references are provided that describe applications of data stream clustering in different domains, such as network intrusion detection, sensor networks, and stock market analysis. Information regarding software packages and data repositories are also available for helping researchers and practitioners. Finally, some important issues and open questions that can be subject of future research are discussed.},

Stream data is different compared to normal data as they are continuously produced from different applications which impose different challenges like massive, infinite, concept drift for processing. An object that does not obey the behavior of normal data object is called outliers. Outlier detection is used in different applications like fraud detection, intrusion detection, track environmental changes, medical diagnosis so there is need to detect outliers from data streams. Various approaches are used for outlier detection. Some of them use K-Means algorithm for outlier detection in data streams which help to create a similar group or cluster of data points. Data stream clustering techniques are highly helpful to cluster similar data items in data streams and also to detect the outliers from them, so they are called cluster based outlier detection. K-means algorithm is partition based algorithm which is used for clustering datasets into number of clusters. It is most common and popular algorithm for clustering due to its simplicity and efficiency. Purpose of this paper is to review of different approaches of outlier detection which is used for K-Means algorithm for clustering dataset with some other methods. Different application areas of outlier detection are discussed in this paper.

  abstract = {An important problem in processing large data streams is detecting changes in the underly-ing distribution that generates the data. The challenge in designing change detection schemes is making them general, scalable, and statistically sound. In this paper, we take a general, information-theoretic approach to the change detection problem, which works for multidimen-sional as well as categorical data. We use relative entropy, also called the Kullback-Leibler distance, to measure the difference between two given distributions. The KL-distance is known to be related to the optimal error in determining whether the two distributions are the same and draws on fundamental results in hypothesis testing. The KL-distance also generalizes tradi-tional distance measures in statistics, and has invariance properties that make it ideally suited for comparing distributions. Our scheme is general; it is nonparametric and requires no assumptions on the underlying distributions. It employs a statistical inference procedure based on the theory of bootstrapping, which allows us to determine whether our measurements are statistically significant. The scheme is also quite flexible from a practical perspective; it can be implemented using any spatial parti-tioning scheme that scales well with dimensionality. In addition to providing change detections, our method generalizes Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic, allowing us to quantitatively identify specific regions in space where large changes have occurred. We provide a detailed experimental study that demonstrates the generality and efficiency of our approach with different kinds of multidimensional datasets, both synthetic and real.},

When a new concept drift occurs, the algorithm compares the new context to previous ones using a non-parametric multivariate statistical test to verify if both contexts come from the same distribution. If so, the correspondi ng classifier is reused. The RCD framework is compared with several algorithms (among single and ensemble approaches), in both artificial and real data sets, chosen from frequently used algorithms and data sets in the concept drift research area.

However, in real-world applications, such as credit fraud and intrusion detection, this assumption is not always valid. Thus, it is a challenge to learn from concept drifting data streams with unlabeled data. With this motivation, we propose a Semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with concept drifts and UNlabeled data (SUN) in this paper. In SUN, a clustering algorithm is developed from k-Modes and implemented to produce concept clusters at leaves in an incremental decision tree. In terms of deviations between history concept clusters and new ones, potential concept drifts are distinguished from noise. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that SUN performs well compared to several state-of-the-art online supervised and semi-supervised algorithms, even when there are more than 90{\%} unlabeled data. A conclusion is hence drawn that SUN provides a promising framework for tackling concept drifting data streams with unlabeled data.},

Streaming data can be considered as one of the main sources of what is called big data. While predictive modeling for data streams and big data have received a lot of attention over the last decade, many research approaches are typically designed for well-behaved controlled problem settings, overlooking important challenges imposed by real-world applications. This article presents a discussion on eight open challenges for data stream mining. Our goal is to identify gaps between current research and meaningful applications, highlight open problems, and define new application-relevant research directions for data stream mining. The identified challenges cover the full cycle of knowledge discovery and involve such problems as: protecting data privacy, dealing with legacy systems, handling incomplete and delayed information, analysis of complex data, and evaluation of stream mining algorithms. The resulting analysis is illustrated by practical applications and provides general suggestions concerning lines of future research in data stream mining.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Data stream mining is a fast growing research topic due to the ubiquity of data in several real-world problems. Given their ephemeral nature, data stream sources are expected to undergo changes in data distribution, a phenomenon called concept drift. This paper focuses on one specific type of drift that has not yet been thoroughly studied, namely feature drift. Feature drift occurs whenever a subset of features becomes, or ceases to be, relevant to the learning task; thus, learners must detect and adapt to these changes accordingly. We survey existing work on feature drift adaptation with both explicit and implicit approaches. Additionally, we benchmark several algorithms and a naive feature drift detection approach using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results from our experiments indicate the need for future research in this area as even naive approaches produced gains in accuracy while reducing resources usage. Finally, we state current research topics, challenges and future directions for feature drift adaptation.},

  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Mining the potential value hidden behind big data has been a popular research topic around the world. For an infinite big data scenario, the underlying data distribution of newly arrived data may be appeared differently from the old one in the real world. This phenomenon is so-called the concept-drift problem that exists commonly in the scenario of big data mining. In the past decade, decision tree inductions use multi-tree learning to detect the drift using alternative trees as a solution. However, multi-tree algorithms consume more computing resources than the singletree. This paper proposes a singletree with an optimized node-splitting mechanism to detect the drift in a test-then-training tree-building process. In the experiment, we compare the performance of the new method to some state-of-art singletree and multi-tree algorithms. Result shows that the new algorithm performs with good accuracy while a more compact model size and less use of memory than the others.},

@article{Li2015,
  abstract = {a b s t r a c t Few online classification algorithms based on traditional inductive ensembling, such as online bagging or boosting, focus on handling concept drifting data streams while performing well on noisy data. Motivated by this, an incremental algorithm based on Ensemble Decision Trees for Concept-drifting data streams (EDTC) is proposed in this paper. Three variants of random feature selection are introduced to implement split-tests and two thresholds specified in Hoeffding Bounds inequality are utilized to distinguish concept drifts from noisy data. Extensive studies on synthetic and real streaming databases demonstrate that our algorithm of EDTC performs very well compared to several known online algorithms based on single models and ensemble models. A conclusion is hence drawn that multiple solutions are provided for learning from concept drifting data streams under noise.},

  abstract = {â€” In this paper, a new method for constructing decision trees for stream data is proposed. First a new split-ting criterion based on the misclassification error is derived. A theorem is proven showing that the best attribute computed in considered node according to the available data sample is the same, with some high probability, as the attribute derived from the whole infinite data stream. Next this result is combined with the splitting criterion based on the Gini index. It is shown that such combination provides the highest accuracy among all studied algorithms.},

In Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), many intelligent information processing methods, data mining technology and so on have been applied to improve detection accuracy for IPv4 network. IPv6 will inevitably take the place of IPv4 as the next generation of the Internet Protocol. Considering the problem of the urgent requirement of IDS for IPv6 networks, we present a novel intrusion detection model, and successfully applied it into an IPv6 experimental network in our lab. Lots of experiment indicated that this model can work well for intrusion detection for IPv6 network.},

The complexity, accessibility, and openness of the Internet have served to increase the security risk of information systems tremendously. This paper concerns intrusion detection. We describe approaches to intrusion detection using neural networks and support vector machines. The key ideas are to discover useful patterns or features that describe user behavior on a system, and use the set of relevant features to build classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions, hopefully in real time. Using a set of benchmark data from a KDD (knowledge discovery and data mining) competition designed by DARPA, we demonstrate that efficient and accurate classifiers can be built to detect intrusions. We compare the performance of neural networks based, and support vector machine based, systems for intrusion detection},
