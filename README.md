# DMProject

Just a small course project.

## Structure

The data can be downloaded from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/kddcup99-mld/).

Folders:
* `data`: put all the datasets, listed as follows:
    - `kddcup.data_10_percent_corrected` the main dataset(*for now*)
    - `kddcup.names` the names file from the dataset. 
    
* `dmproject` main code folder
* `tools` some small code files for something like analysing the dataset. 

*_notice_*: In `.gitignore` file, ignore the `data/` folder, cause it's really large.

## Roadmap (a sketch)

Algorithms:
 
* KNN method.
* Hierarchical clustering method.
* Other density based method? (maybe)

Pre-processing methods:
* normalization methods?
* feature selection? (maybe)
